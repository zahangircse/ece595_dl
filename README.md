Title: Deep Learning (DL)
Course No: ECE-595_DL

Here, I am providing codes for the individual lecture

The DL class will conver the topic including:
    1. Multilayer perceptron neural network (MLP)
    2. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
    3. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
    4. Deep Belief Networks (DBN)
    5. Auto-Encoder (AE) and its variants
    6. Generative adversarial networks (GAN)
    6. Reinforcement Learning (RL) and so on.
